# WM Concepts Front-End
This is the main website for WM Concepts. There should be 4 pages: main page, client page, developer page, and mentor page. The client, developer, and mentor pages 
should have a form to enter the corresponding information. For the client page, the user should be able to enter potential project details and submit them for our 
consideration. For the developer page, the user should be able to apply for developer status and be able to be interviewed/considered for working projects. For the 
mentor page, the user should be able to apply to become a mentor and work with our junior developers on projects.

# Deployment
This site is set up to be deployed the same as our standard applications. It will require deployment in GCP and the form data should be stored in PostgreSQL.
