    So you have your certificate or degree. Congratulations! What now? Every junior posted job lists 2-3 years of experience as a requirement. Where do you get that experience? Open source can be helpful but who validates your experience or contributions? Personal projects are great but can be hard to focus on. And where do you turn when you hit a roadblock or just have a design question?

    The answer: Work for WM Concepts! We hire Junior programmers and give them access to our network of senior programmers focusing on answering questions and mentoring junior developers. We provide training videos for various development activities such as best practices for front-end password handling on GCP, configuring GCP for new middle end services using cloud run and cloud build, designing your system, and how to use coding AI’s.
